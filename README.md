## How do wildfires impact our lives?
---
Wildfires are a growing threat across the entire united states. These disasters affecting not only the enviroment but also our daily lives in unexpected ways. Our project was designed to analyze how wildfires impacting energy stabilization by examining key factors such as wildfires incidents, power outages, eletricity demand, etc. We also using wildfires incidents data and machine learning(Decision Trees) to explore and predict wildfires caused and occurences based on the datasets. To analyze the impact of the wirdfires on energy system, we evaluated five critical data points: 
<ul>
  <li style="color: black;">Number of wildfires per state</li>
  <li style="color: black;">Power outage instances per state</li>
  <li style="color: black;">Solar adoption rate per state</li>
  <li style="color: black;">Electricity rates per state</li>
  <li style="color: black;">Emissions per capita per state</li>
</ul>
<br>
By analyzing these factors, we defined which states have "more stable" and "less stable" energy systems, ranking them based on energy stability(wildfire related disruptions).<br>
States like Texas, Arizona have unstable energy solar resources but also face wildfire threat, making them critical areas for balancing energy resilience and renewable adoption. <br>
Our goal is to use valuable data to analyze states that are unstable and facing wildfires. By identifying correlations between wildfire occurance and energy instability, we aim to contribute recommendations that can inform energy providers which states have high renewable energy potential considering wildfires and help strengthen power outages against the increasisng threat of wildfires.
